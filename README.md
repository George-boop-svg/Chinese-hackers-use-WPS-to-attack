# China-office-software-wps-web-command-execution
When the wps software is running, an api interface with port 4709 will be opened. An attacker can request this interface to execute commands.

# What is Wps?
WPS Office is a widely used office suite with a user base of over 200 million, developed by Chinese company Kingsoft.

# What is Wps wpscloudsvr Api?
As we said, wps(wpscloudsvr.exe)will listen to port 127.0.0.1:4709 when it starts, but it cannot be accessed by normal access. You need to use a domain name to access, such as: http://localhost.wbridge.wps.cn:4709

If you run wps and find that port 4709 is listened to, you can directly access the URL.

# How to use api to execute commands?

Some time ago we captured a web request from an attacker as follows:
```
POST /command/invoke HTTP/1.1

```
After the above request package is executed, the api interface of wps will be triggered and a wps official website will be opened. The attacker's malicious payload will be stored in the website. After loading, the backdoor will be downloaded to the specified directory and run.

## Simple analysis
Letâ€™s do a simple analysis here.
Through reverse analysis, we found that cmd is the base64-encoded WPS official website domain name, because WPS restricts only some whitelisted domain names to be opened with the built-in browser, and those not in the whitelist can be opened with the user's default browser.whitelisted domain like:*.wps.cn  *.wps.com  *.wpscdn.cn  *.kdocs.cn  ....

### About Sign Token
```
md5(cmd + '_qingLaunchKey_')
```

# How hackers exploited the vulnerability?
We found that Chinese hackers are using this method to attack!
```
        (attack)
hacker >>>>>>>>>> web site(Install Js Payload Backdoor)
        (access)                           (run js payload)
user   >>>>>>>>>> web site(Hacker attack)   >>>>>>>>>>  attack wps (if you start wps and 4709 open)    >>>>>>>>>>  install backdoor
```

# End
If you want to implement command execution, you can go to https://www.wps.cn to download the software for testing.
